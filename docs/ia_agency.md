# Agency in Analytics?
One of the key goals for Analytics is to support the work managers do in the field. The timelines and systems built by Impact analytics for FY22 are designed to have **room for agency at the school level** for changes to processes as well as wiggle room on timing based on the windows we provide. While we have been around a while and have a sense of what an average timeline should be we do not know what your team and school experience is. This means as a program manager you will need to make your own adjustments to the timelines, rollouts and conceptual understandings of the items we mention below. **Work with your PD to determine how you will accomplish the tasks outlined in this document** and feel free to reach out to the Impact Analytics team if you have questions.

This document will be updated over time with new resources and directions for key items:
- [Recommended timelines for processes and trainings](analyticsbyquarter.md) **(Schools set actual dates)** 
- [Links to resources and workbooks](attachments.md])
- General explanations for why and how
