Renaissance Learning is a global reading and math solutions ed-tech company working in K-12. They use data to support student learning in ELA and Math with a host of digital assessments, reading and curriculum platforms. Schoolzilla is a public benefit company with a mission to enable people to use data to improve educational outcomes for students. They democratize and simplify data access with their online school and student dashboard platform called Mosaic.

Inglewood Unified as graciously allowed us to have access to their student data systems via Schoolzilla Mosaic. This pilot will hopefully help us make better informed decisions around student interventions, focus list selection and ongoing observations about what students need from corps members.

Mosaic has a possibility to be a great option to augment and enhance City Years existing Ed-Tech tools (Cyschoolhouse, Power BI and CYConnect). We hope to align to using the tools that Inglewood Unified is using to support students in the class by seeing up to date attendance, behavior and course performance data that are housed in Mosaic.

Once you sign in with your username and password you will be taken to the district profile homepage for Mosaic. If you are a corps member, manager or director you should be able to view aggrigated district level data to see how your school/students compare to all students overall. From here you can navigate around Mosaic to view data on the district, schools and groups of schools in aggrigate. If you want to see specific data on students you need to navigate to the "Our Students" and "Student Profile" sections explained below.

## District Profile Overview

The District Profile view give you a glance at how the district is doing overall. This page gives context for how students are doing overall at the district for each card of data like enrollment, attendance, behavior and course performance. The video below provides a quick walkthrough of how to use this page.

<div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/83e0e6d8-d571-4be1-87ff-eb371214f11c?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>

### District Profile Use Cases

The District Profile can give some good baseline comparsions for average data points like student attendance and behavior that may be informative to goal setting with focus list students. It can also be helpful for development in grant writing and demographics reporting on the students we are serving in the classroom.

## Our Schools Overview

Like the District Profile view this page contains aggregated student data by school useful for school comparisons within the district. You can sort and filter the page to see specific subgroups of students and compare whole schools in attendance, behavior and course performance. For more information on this page see the video below.

<div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/83e0e6d8-d571-4be1-87ff-eb371214f11c?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>

### Our Schools Use Cases

The Our Schools page allows us to make comparisions between our school/students and other schools. When split by grade level this can be particularly useful for goal setting and context. It is also handy for seeing the highest performing schools and student subsets to give further information for goal setting and context for student performance overall.

## Our Students Overview

The next two sections are most applicable for corps members and program staff given that they contain student level data. The Our students page will only show you data on your whole school and/or focus list so that you can see how students are performing in attendance, behavior, course performance and on assessments. This page also has some great grouping features that allow you to make custom groups of students for focus list selection, student interventions and more. See the video below to learn about how to use this page.

<div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/83e0e6d8-d571-4be1-87ff-eb371214f11c?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>

## Student Profile Overview

The student profile page allows you to dive deep into current and historical student performance to see overall and class by class breakdowns of how a student is performing. This page gives you a broad picture of studnet performance and is great to use for planning during the course of the year, in goal setting with students and monitoring progress towards on track goals. See the video below for an overview of this page.

<div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/83e0e6d8-d571-4be1-87ff-eb371214f11c?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>
