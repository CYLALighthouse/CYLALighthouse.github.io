# Extended Learning Time

With a new data use agreement from both of our school districts in FY21 our after school data management processes need to undergo some changes. Additionally corps members have expressed how complicated tracking time in ELT has been so in FY22 the Analytics team is hoping to make some simplifications and improvements to ELT attendance tracking while **also adding some important steps** to comply with our new data agreements.

## ELT Data Management

### What are we doing again with ELT Workbooks?

City Year needs to make sure that we get guardian consent for any student participating in after school. City Year also needs to ensure that when students come to our program that we are keeping track of the total time they spend in our program so that we can report to guardians, school partners and external partners the scope of our program overall and individual student participation. In prior years we would do this by using CYSchoolhouse to track total time in ELT but student records might have been missing and the extra steps in using CYSchoolhouse complicated the work. In FY22 we are trying to reduce the workload of ELT data processes and comply with new expectations from our districts to track ELT time only in Excel.

At a high level team leaders are responsible for making sure data processes happen for their school. This involves the following steps.

1.	Printing and distributing ELT applications to students in English and Spanish.
2.	Digitizing returned ELT applications and ensuring all key application fields are properly filled out
3.	Building out ELT print rosters and/or keeping ELT time tracking up to date weekly in Excel
4. Ensuring time entry happens accurately for all students in Excel
5. Reviewing ELT data for your school and seeking to improve your program.

The ELT workbooks will help you complete these tasks and hopefully with a combination of resources, videos and regular office hours with Analytics we can get a regular cadence going to make this work easy.

For a high level review of these processes see the video below.

### The Purpose of ELT Time Tracking

To do all the five steps above means you as a team leader may need to carve out time in your day to keep data entry for applications and attendance time up to date. The reason this is important is because of some of the scenarios described below that can only be answered by keeping ELT data up to date.

1.	Partner teachers giving extra credit for student attendance
2.	Parent/guardians wanting proof of student ELT attendance
3.	Liability waivers to confirm/deny student attendance in case of incidents
4.	Partners wanting us to quantify the size and scope of our after school programming
5.	Funders and grants seeking to support and grow after school programs
6.	Evaluation of our work to determine if ELT supports student academic growth

For these reasons we ask that every school ensure all students have a submitted ELT application on file with guardian consent, that students and corps members track student time in/time out and total minutes each day in the program and that all this data is entered in ELT workbooks on Cyconnect so that this data can be viewed centrally for the needs of partners and the site.

See below for a walkthrough of each part of the ELT data management process.

### ELT Applications (Every Student Needs One)

As part of our data agreement with LAUSD all students will need to have an ELT application on file BEFORE attending after school programming in FY22. If a student attends ELT without an application City Year runs the risk of being sued if anything happens to the child while they are in the care of City Year (This has happened in the past). Additionally if there is a medical emergency with a student we need to know who to contact or if they have medical insurance. 

To ensure that we are protecting ourselves legally AND that we are keeping students safe by having emergency contact information on hand for our students we will need all students to have an ELT application and to have that application digitized into the ELT workbooks on Cyconnect.

To learn more about the applications processes see this video.

<div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/802faf3d-c99e-4dcd-93f8-69d8eb5a54b1?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>


### Student Records

When you enter a students ELT application you want to see if the parent/guardian provided a student ID. In many cases they will not and you will need to check the student’s name and grade against our “Student Records” table. This is a list of students from the classes we serve in that will be loaded into your ELT workbooks around September when the district provides CYLA with student enrollment information.

If you are unable to find the students ID you can “make up” an ID for the student until such a time that you can find the students real ID and update it on the ELT application.

You will want to periodically check and update student IDs to prevent creating duplicate student records. See below for a full video on the Student Records page.

<div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/6adfee81-1620-4062-9eb6-618bc0ed2f0b?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>

### Print Roster


The ELT print roster is designed to be a template to print pre-populated attendance trackers for ELT. We recommend you use paper trackers to physically track time with students but if you prefer to enter ELT time directly into the “Time Entry Roster” page you can opt out of printing rosters weekly.

Note that to use the Print Roster you will need to select ACMs and Students from the dropdowns on the roster and update the dropdown for the given week to keep the dates matching for the given week. For a full overview video on the Print Roster page see below:

<div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/cf216575-20d0-40a2-b624-e2e285e7b54a?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>

### ELT Entry Roster

If you have done the previous steps of entering student ELT applications, updating the “student records” page, filled out the optional print roster and begun your ELT program you are ready to start tracking ELT attendance time with students. Like the print roster page you will need to fill out the ACM and student who will be attending ELT, as well as do some name matching between the student records and ELT applications page to ensure no duplicate students. Once your student info has been put in Columns B:D then you are all set to record time in an time out with students. For a full video walkthrough of this page see the video below.

<div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/d38538e7-6e61-472f-9e2f-cab77c76ef59?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>

### ELT Data

Once you enter data into the “Time Entry Roster” you can go to the ELT data page and load in cleaned data that will give you useful information about your ELT program. Analytics should refresh this page once a day but if you need to update it sooner you can do so by opening the ELT workbooks in a desktop version of Excel and clicking on the refresh all button.

### ELT Dashboard

After all other processes have been completed and all tables have been refreshed then you can view your programs ELT data. The ELT Dashboard gives a program overall and ACM by ACM view of some key ELT metrics. For a full walkthrough of the dashboard the video below.

### ELT Roles

Below is a table that helps to clarify the roles of everyone in after school data management. While the program manager is ultimately the person who supervises all school based activities we view the Team Leader as the owner of most day to day extended learning time activities, logistics and execution. This is particularly true when it involves the data that is being managed for ELT.
Team leaders will be the people that Impact Analytics reaches out to when ELT applications need to be entered into the system, when student IDs need correcting, when time entry needs to happen more regularly and more. We hope to have regular check ins with team leaders to support them in all of these tasks moving forward.

### ELT Applications
As part of our data agreement with LAUSD all students will need to have an ELT application on file BEFORE attending after school programming in FY22. If a student attends ELT without an application City Year runs the risk of being sued if anything happens to the child while they are in the care of City Year (This has happened in the past).

To learn more about the applications processes see [this video.]()

### ELT Workbooks

Part of the role of a team leader will be to ensure all ELT applications, student enrollment and time in and out is recorded daily on the Analytics provided Extended Learning Time Workbooks. The two main purposes of these ELT workbooks are to verify student ELT applications and to provide a space for tracking program attendance so that we can determine if our program is meeting our desired outcomes.

ELT workbooks should be available to team leaders in early August and specific trainings for team leaders will be upcoming. Come back for links to said trainings and resources later.

## ELT Data Entry and Roles Checklist

City Year Los Angeles After school supports students by extending the school day, providing space for enrichment activities and homework support. Our school partners, student guardians and organizational funders are keen to know how our after school programs are doing and this means we need to track some basic data on the students attending our enrichment activities. The items below explain the roles and tasks of tracking student attendance data for After school.

### ELT Role Clarity

In FY22 team leaders will be responsible for managing the collection and digitization of ELT applications from students at their school. Team Leaders should carve out some time each week to collect and organize ELT applications in an easy to access binder before digitizing them into their teams ELT Rosters in Excel. This is a new process for the 2021=2022 school year but necessary as our data agreements with LAUSD and IUSD have changed and we are now obligated to ensure every student has an ELT application on file that is tied to their student ID. Chances are that many students ELT applications wont have their ID when submitted so Team leaders will need to periodically go to school partners to collect any missing student IDs that Team leaders could not find on the “student records” page of the ELT workbook.

Additionally, this year team leaders will be responsible for printing out ELT attendance rosters to help ACMs sign students into and out of the program. Alternatively, team leaders can also just regularly enter attendance in and out time into the Excel workbooks “Time Entry” page. The choice between entering time on paper before backlogging it into the “Time Entry” page or just entering it during ELT is up to each school to decide. Sometimes schools with ELT in multiple locations prefer the paper method while other schools may find it best to just enter student time in and out directly into the spreadsheets.

Team leaders should work with their program managers to determine how to ensure all attendance time is being recorded with students each day. Reasons why tracking time in after school is so important is because City Year needs to be able to articulate to schools and guardians when students arrived and left our program, who might have picked students up from Elementary schools (Initials fields) and how often/much a student attended our program.


### Checklist for ELT Workbook Tasks
>- [ ] Collect all ELT applications and digitize their records in the “Paper Applications” page of the ELT Roster.
>   - Ensure that all fields in orange are present. If not send the application back. Students cant attend ELT until the application is complete.
>- [ ] Build out a list of students who are attending your ELT programming on the “Enrolled Students” page.
>- [ ] Don’t forget to match student names up between the name coming from the “Student Records” page and the “Paper Applications” page. This helps you ensure all students in your program have a completed application!
>- [ ] Build out the optional “Print Roster” and “Time Entry” pages with your enrolled students and associated corps member pairings.
>   - The ACM name next to the student record will help denote the ACM pod and/or room that a student occupies.
>- [ ] Ensure all time in/out is being recorded daily/weekly in the “Time Entry” page of the ELT workbook.
>    - This helps us communicate to partners how many students are in our after school program and answer questions about student attendance, arrival and departure.
>- [ ] Talk to the Impact Analytics questions when you have:
>   - Questions about ELT data tasks
>    - Issues with workbooks
>    - Feedback for tool improvement
>    - Data isn’t refreshing properly
>    - (Cbischel@cityyear.org)
