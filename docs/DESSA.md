# Devereux Student Strengths Assessment

Last Update: 11/10/2021 @ 3:13pm

## What is DESSA?

The [DESSA](https://apertureed.com/research/about-the-dessa/) is a Socio-Emotional Learning assessment that allows educators to measure and take action on student social and emotional learning. The DESSA is based on [resiliance Theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-3661-4_14) and uses the [CASEL Framework](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/) as the basis for the eight competencies observed under the assessment.

As noted by Aperture Education (the organization that administers the DESSA)

> "The DESSA is commonly used to inform the delivery of SEL at Tier 1 or Tier 2 as well as measuring the results of that delivery. The DESSA suite includes assessments and screeners that adapt to K-8 and 9-12 settings."

DESSA observations can be completed by an array of school based staff and is based on student strengths aka positive behaviors. Raters are asked to submit responses based on a five point scale on how often students engage in a specific behavior over the last four weeks.

## City Year and DESSA

City Year uses the DESSA as both an observational note catcher and a resource for materials that help us support students in any and all of the eight related SEL competencies rated on the DESSA.
