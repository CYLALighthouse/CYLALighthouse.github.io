# Devereux Student Strengths Assessment

## What is DESSA?

The [DESSA](https://apertureed.com/research/about-the-dessa/) is a Socio-Emotional Learning assessment that allows educators to measure and take action on student social and emotional learning. 

The DESSA is based on [resiliance Theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-3661-4_14) and uses the [CASEL Framework](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/) as the basis for the eight competencies observed under the assessment.

As noted by organization that administers the DESSA (ApertureEducation) 

"The DESSA is commonly used to inform the delivery of SEL at Tier 1 or Tier 2 as well as measuring the results of that delivery. The DESSA suite includes assessments and screeners that adapt to K-8 and 9-12 settings."

The DESSA observations can be completed by an array of school based staff and is based on student strengths aka positive behaviors. Raters are asked to submit responses based on a five point scale on how often students engage in a specific behavior over the last four weeks.
