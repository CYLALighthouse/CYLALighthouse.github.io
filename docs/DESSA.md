# Devereux Student Strengths Assessment

Last Update: 1/14/2021 @ 12:10pm

## What is DESSA?

The [DESSA](https://apertureed.com/research/about-the-dessa/) is a Socio-Emotional Learning assessment that allows educators to measure and take action on student social and emotional learning. The DESSA is based on [resiliance Theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-3661-4_14) and uses the [CASEL Framework](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/) as the basis for the eight competencies observed under the assessment.

As noted by Aperture Education (the organization that administers the DESSA)

> "The DESSA is commonly used to inform the delivery of SEL at Tier 1 or Tier 2 as well as measuring the results of that delivery. The DESSA suite includes assessments and screeners that adapt to K-8 and 9-12 settings."

DESSA observations can be completed by an array of school based staff and is based on student strengths aka positive behaviors. Raters are asked to submit responses based on a five point scale on how often students engage in a specific behavior over the last four weeks.

## City Year and DESSA

City Year uses the DESSA as both an observational note catcher and a resource for materials that help us support students in any and all of the eight related SEL competencies rated on the DESSA.

## DESSA Ratings

See below for a quick walkthrough of how to submit a DESSA 40 rating. Note that before you can submit a rating you must have focus list students enrolled in CYSchoolhouse and those students must be assigned an indicator area. Confirm with your PM if these tasks have been completed prior to submitting a rating.

### Student Rating Report

If you are a corps member and you just want to see a single rating for a single student this is the report for you. See the video below for a walkthrough of how to export this report. Remember to store the exported PDF on a secure section of CYConnect, OneDrive or Teams rather than your local machine.

   <div style='max-width: 640px'><div style='position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;'><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/bf7d7f68-2e13-47f9-b840-e9b248f7674f?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe></div></div>
 
### Multi-Rating or Multi-Student Reports

As a corps member or program manager you may want to run multiple ratings for a single student or run a single rating for multiple students. This report is great for spotting trends and growth over time. Note that this report will only function once two ratings are in SELEvo.
