# What is Impact Analytics
*The mission* of the impact analytics team is *to foster data informed decision making that supports corps and staff in executing towards organizational excellence and student outcomes.*
â€¯ 

What that means in tangible terms is having visualized data (Dashboards) that helped managers put ACMs in the right classes. Having Excel templates that helped track a corps members class schedule and focus list selections. Being able to at a glance review the attendance of students in ELT. Being able to build focus lists that meet the needs of partners and meet our goals as a company. Making sense of the survey data we collect from partners, staff and corps. These and many more items are the ways analytics hopes to inform the decision making of our site.

The day to day things in our wheelhouse include: 

- The process of placing corps members into schools and classes 
- Managing after school data collection 
- Frameworks and criteria for focus list student selection 
- Data visualization and interpretation 
- Data review spaces and progress monitoring 
- Assessment implementation and training 
- General tech support
