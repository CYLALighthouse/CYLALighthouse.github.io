# PowerApps for Internal Use

Microsoft PowerApps is part of your office 365 suite of applications available to you as a staff or corps member. Just like you would log in with a browser to go to CYconnect or outlook you can also access custom applications and forms created by local staff in "PowerApps". You can think of PowerApps as Application Inception. You install or access one application that has additional apps inside it for things like session attendance tracking, user surveys, note taking and other data related tasks at City Year.

You can use PowerApps on Desktop, IOS and Andriod by logging into PowerApps with your City Year credentials (Same login as your email address). From here you will have access to any applications provided to you by City Year staff.

<body><h3 style="background-color:purple;"><c style=color:white;">How to get started</h3></body>

To get started with PowerApps you first want to decide what devices you would like to use. Of course you can use your browser by navigating to https://make.powerapps.com/ but you can also install the PowerApp for IOS [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/power-apps/id1047318566) or Android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msapps&hl=en_US&gl=US) and use PowerApps on your mobile devices. 

While PowerApps works best on mobile you can use a desktop browser for most apps with no issues as well. The Impact Analytics team will send periodic communicaitons with links directly to said applications for use in the browser but you can also go to your available applications [here](https://make.powerapps.com/)] by logging in with your City Year credentials. See below for a how to video for getting started with PowerApps on mobile devices.
