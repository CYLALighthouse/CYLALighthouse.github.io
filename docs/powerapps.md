# PowerApps for Internal Use

Microsoft PowerApps is part of your office 365 suite of applications available to all staff and corps members at City Year. Just like you would log in with a browser to go to [CYconnect](https://cityyear.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Home.aspx) or [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox) you can also access custom applications and forms created by local staff in "PowerApps". You can think of PowerApps as applications within applications **(App Inception)**. It provides a quick and easy way for City Year to deploy forms, apps and other tools quickly without the need to install anything new outside of the first PowerApps setup.

You can use PowerApps on [Desktop](https://make.powerapps.com/), [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/power-apps/id1047318566) and [Andriod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msapps&hl=en_US&gl=US) by logging into PowerApps with your City Year credentials (Same login as your email address). From here you will have access to any applications provided to you by City Year staff.
