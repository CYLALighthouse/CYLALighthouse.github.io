<h3><p style="color:darkturquoise"><i> Final Deployment Workbooks </i></p></h3>

Filling out the **Final Deployment workbooks** is the last step PMs need to take in order to begin the process of recieving student level data for their schools. The information from these workbooks will allows the IA team to request student data that will made accessible to PMs and ACMs through the WSWC Power BI Report.

*In addition to providing IA with ACM class line information, please use your workbook to share partner teacher, admin and/or other staff emails for upcomming partner surveys.*

<h4><p style="color:darkorange"> The Focus List Process </p></h4>

In FY22 the focus list process is being simplified to have less steps and allow for greater flexibility in selecting students. Rather than starting with an initial caseload of 15 students and then narrowing it down to a final focus list, Corps members will only pick a caseload of 11 students when they feel like they have identified the correct students to receive services. The timeline for this process is listed below along with <a href="#good-fl"> recommendations </a> for focus list fit.

The general timelines for the focus list process are below and are subject to change. Keep in mind these are recommended windows in which things should progress and your school may be different.

The Initial Focus List process begins with completing your schoolâ€™s draft Deployment Workbook Template. Completion of the draft Deployment Workbook signifies that your team has been deployed into stable class lines and are ready to take steps towards building their initial focus list. Prior to making selections, ACMs will begin their student observation window (1-2 weeks). During this time, ACMs will begin to identify potential students, have initial conversations with their partner teachers, and explore the Initial indicators dashboard if data is availabe, otherswise ACMs can ask partner teachers for student data.

<section id="good-fl"><h4><p style="color:darkorange"> What to Look for in a Focus List </p></h4></section>

>- Partner Teacher Approval
>- Observations that student is **Off Track** & willing to be coached
>- Data indicates good fit:
>     - D or F in related subject (ELA/Math)
>     - 2 or 3 in Elementary Marks
>     - SED: Behavior infractions and/or 86-95% ADA previous year or currently

Please note that data indicators are not definitive criteria for selecting a focus list student. ACMs should also consider partner teacher input and their own observations. However, focus list students must be off track to join a caseload. If student data is not available on Power BI, ACMs should try to get this data from their partner teachers.

<h4><p style="color:darkorange"> Accessing Power BI </p></h4>

1. Visit app.powerbi OR find the yellow Power BI icon in the app launcher found int he top lef-hand corner of your outlook email or on any page on cyconnect

<img src="_images/app-launcher.PNG" alt="app-launcher" style="width:20%;"/>

2. Go to Apps using the left-hand navigation
3. Find the CYLA WSWC Progress Monitoring Reports App

<img src="_images/WSWC-app.PNG" alt="WSWC-app" style="width:100%;"/>

4. Use the left-hand navigation to find the "FY22 Progress Monitoring" dashboard

<u><h4> What you will find in the Initial Indicators page: </u></h4>

| Data You Will See                        | Data You *Might* See                     |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| General student demographics: Grade, ELL Status, ELD Level, SPED Indicator | Previous year course grades (ELA/Math)   |
| Current course grades from most recent marking period                      | # of Failed Courses in the previous year |
| Most recent attendance rate                                                | Previous Year attendance rate            |
| ACMs use Power BI EWI Pages                                                | ELA/Math SBAC bands from previous year   |


<h4><p style="color:darkorange"> Accessing Mosaic </p></h4>

ACMs serving in a IUSD school will have access to student data via a platform call Schoolzille Mosaic. Here ACMs will have access to course performance, assessment, and demographics data for the students in their classes. They should use Schoolzilla Mosaic to help them select focus list students. In order for them to do this, PMs must walk them through the following two trainings:

> 1. [Mosaic Account Set-Up Training](https://bit.ly/3lj8TUZ)
> 2. [Mosaic Focus List Training](https://bit.ly/3kecFQt)
