## Getting Teacher Data

Data is key to much of what the Analytics team does each year but as a contractor for the district we can only get a limited scope of data and it must be stored securely. For both of our school districts the process of getting student data is different. See your school district below for more specifics on how to get school specific data for ACM deployment, focus lists and ELT.

### Los Angeles Unified School District

In June CYLA should communicate to LAUSD Office of Data and Accountability about re-establishing a data use contract for the coming school year. *This process has been historically slow and should be started as soon as possible*

1. Program Directors (PDs) and or Program Managers (Pms) should assist in this process by asking their partners to run a teacher schedule report. Teacher schedule reports should be uploaded here and then an email should be sent to the IA team. ()
   - Download directions for pulling teacher schedule report for your partner teachers here.

2. Pms should fill out a draft depoyment workbook to assign ACMs to class lines as they wait for teacher schedule reports from their school. Directions on how to get and use a draft deployment workbook can be foud in the section below.
   - Use Team Demographics Dashboard to help you place ACMs into class lines 


### Inglewood Unified School District

Inglewood uses a data platform called Schoolzilla to manage their data. City Year uses Schoolzilla to access student performance data for your schools. Sometime in the first quarter the Analytics team will provide a training specifically for IUSD schools on how to access Schoolzilla for viewing student performance data.

1. Pms should fill out a draft depoyment workbook to assign ACMs to class lines. Directions on how to get and use a draft deployment workbook can be foud in the section below.
   - Use Team Demographics Dashboard to help you place ACMs into class lines


## Draft Deployment Workbook

In the summer, as you plan with partners where ACMs will be placed into class lines, please fill out a copy of the draft deployment workbook. The IA team has build out the Team Demographics Dashboard to assist with this process by providing information that might help with assigning class lines. See the section below for more info on the dashboard.

This workbook will be a placeholder for the Final Deployment Workbook that will be released when you have submitted a teacher schedule report. The final workbook will then become a key part of our data model and will be used to get access to student data from those specified class lines. Without a draft or final deployment, our team will not be able to access data for students in ACM classes, please complete by: (XX/XX/XXXX).
