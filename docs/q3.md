## Review CYSH Lightning Training

- Add link for the PPT training

## Validate Focus List Sections on CYSH

1. Do all ACMs have a full caseload? (Power BI PSLT Workbook)
2. Do all ACMs have a full SED caseload? (Power BI PSLT Workbook)
3. Do any ACMs need to add a new or missing focus list student?
4. Do any ACMs need to remove a focus list student?

## Manage Focus List Changes in CYSH

In pervious years the Impact Analytics team processed all focus list changes through a form on cyconnect. This meant that changes could take 1-2 business days to process. In FY19, a group of program managers piloted managing their own focus lists on CYSH. The results were positive and in FY20 +, program managers are trained to use CYSH to manage their own caseloads. Program Managers are welcome to use any FERPA compliant tool to help keep track of changes that need to be made to ACMs caseloads and the IA team has also provided a template via the focus list workbooks. Below are resources for using CYSH.


>- Each Focus List Workbook has an **FL Changes** Tab
>- ACMS can use columns 3-11 to identify the student(s), the change they need, the section they are located in, and the drop or enrollment date
>- PMs can use column 12 to keep track of their actions: pending, approved, complete, denied
