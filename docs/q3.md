## Validate Focus List Sections on CYSH

1. Do all ACMs have a full caseload? [Power BI PSLT Workbook](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/apps/ef5c272b-d1fa-43af-9087-89a6e1bfc5f4/reports/c4be0a62-cb5d-4b0f-b368-55c0e04050ae/ReportSection23ee6aa2b060d0c0a389?ctid=a5c7899f-d129-48f6-ac88-8f97f366da74&bookmarkGuid=Bookmarkb2a3738a9f701600ef4b)
2. Do all ACMs have a full SED caseload? [Power BI PSLT Workbook](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/apps/ef5c272b-d1fa-43af-9087-89a6e1bfc5f4/reports/c4be0a62-cb5d-4b0f-b368-55c0e04050ae/ReportSection23ee6aa2b060d0c0a389?ctid=a5c7899f-d129-48f6-ac88-8f97f366da74&bookmarkGuid=Bookmark2b8d931bece57598d3cb)
3. Do any ACMs need to add a new or missing focus list student?
4. Do any ACMs need to remove a focus list student?

## Manage Focus List Changes in CYSH

In pervious years the Impact Analytics team processed all focus list changes through a form on cyconnect. This meant that changes could take 1-2 business days to process. In FY19, a group of program managers piloted managing their own focus lists on CYSH. The results were positive and in FY20 +, program managers are trained to use CYSH to manage their own caseloads. Program Managers are welcome to use any FERPA compliant tool to help keep track of changes that need to be made to ACMs caseloads and the IA team has also provided a template via the focus list workbooks. Below are resources for using CYSH.


>- Each Focus List Workbook has an **FL Changes** Tab
>- ACMS can use columns 3-11 to identify the student(s), the change they need, the section they are located in, and the drop or enrollment date
>- PMs can use column 12 to keep track of their actions: pending, approved, complete, denied

## Clean-up DESSA Duplicate ratings

- Before we start the next DESSA Round we need to clean up the data in Aperture. View [this dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/apps/e9ba0db1-f81b-4997-96e7-19bef83819f1/reports/448648d3-78e2-4ab5-a1ad-3a0fa9ed9aad/ReportSection7b448b78ec0ca03c0933?ctid=a5c7899f-d129-48f6-ac88-8f97f366da74) to see if your team has any duplicate assessments from the Previous Assessment.

- Once we opened the WSWC Dashboard we will use the second half of the dashboard. It is under the title **"Please Fix Duplicate DESSA Submissions"**

- This first table will show what ACM's have duplicate assessments and what students have more than 1 assessment during a DESSA Window.

<img src="_images/Duplicate_Assessments.PNG" alt="Duplicate Assessments" style="width:100%;"/>

- Once we have identified what student(s) have duplicate assessments, you can click on the student's name in the table and the table next to it will filter to the multiple assessments and the dates they were administered.

<img src="_images/Duplicate_Assessment_Dates.PNG" alt="Duplicate Assessment Dates" style="width:100%;"/>

- To support with cleaning the data you will need to submit a [help desk](https://cityyear.sharepoint.com/teams/lax/Lists/Test/Issue/newifs.aspx?List=53a03e3a-0288-41d4-b12c-bcdd86af087f&Source=https%3a//cityyear.sharepoint.com/teams/lax/Pages/My-CYLA-Help-Desk-Cases.aspx&RootFolder=&Web=23636188-2f45-4295-809c-a8ec947729e4) or send a teams message to the IA team. ***Please remember to not send Student information via email. The Help Desk and Teams are the FERPA Compliant ways to send student information.***
- The information that the IA team will need to support in deleting a duplicate assessment is: The Student Name, the DESSA Rating Date, the student's CYID and the T-Score. Send this information to the IA team and they will support in deleting the duplicate assessment.
