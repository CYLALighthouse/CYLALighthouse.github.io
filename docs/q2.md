## Final Deployment Workbooks

Filling out the **Final Deployment workbooks** is the last step PMs need to take in order to begin the process of recieving student level data for their schools. The information from these workbooks will allows the IA team to request student data that will made accessible to PMs and ACMs through the WSWC Power BI Report.

*In addition to providing IA with ACM class line information, please use your workbook to share partner teacher, admin and/or other staff emails for upcomming partner surveys.* To access your workbooks, please go to your [school dashboard](https://cityyear.sharepoint.com/teams/lax/LaxPrivate/LAProServe/SitePages/School%20Dashboards.aspx) page on cyconnect or follow the direct links to the library below:

## Support ACMs with Focus List Selections

<h4><p style="color:darkorange"> The Focus List Process </p></h4>

In FY23 the focus list process is being simplified to have less steps and allow for greater flexibility in selecting students. Rather than starting with an initial caseload of 15 students and then narrowing it down to a final focus list, Corps members will only pick a caseload of **11 students** when they feel like they have identified the correct students to receive services. The timeline for this process is listed below along with recommendations for focus list fit.

The general timelines for the focus list process are below and are subject to change. Keep in mind these are recommended windows in which things should progress and your school may be different.

The Initial Focus List process begins with completing your school’s draft Deployment Workbook Template. Completion of the draft Deployment Workbook signifies that your team has been deployed into stable class lines and are ready to take steps towards building their initial focus list. Prior to making selections, ACMs will begin their student observation window (1-2 weeks). During this time, ACMs will begin to identify potential students, have initial conversations with their partner teachers, and explore the Early Warning Indicator (EWI) page in the Progress Monitoring dashboard if data is availabe, otherswise ACMs can ask partner teachers for student data.

### What to Look for in a Focus List

>- Partner Teacher Approval
>- Observations that student is **Off Track** & ***willing to be coached***
>- Data indicates good fit:
>     - D or F in related subject (ELA/Math) OR 2 or 3 in Elementary Marks
>        - applies to prior year data or current year data 
>     - SED: Behavior infractions and/or 86-95% ADA previous year or currently

Please note that data indicators are not definitive criteria for selecting a focus list student. ACMs should also consider partner teacher input and their own observations. **However our state commission grant expects us to work with focus list students who are "off track" in the area we are providing services.** If data is not available at the time of focus list selection use your partner teachers and in class observations to make the best selections possible. ACMs might be able to request data from their partner teachers as well.

## Q1 ACME Survey

The headquarters AmeriCorps Member Experience team runs a survey every quarter for corps members to give their input on key questions used by the organization to monitor the experience and engagement of the corps in their service year. 

The first AmeriCorps Member Experience Survey of the year will take place during the month of September and will be focused on the ACM onboarding and L&D experience.

Please periodically check ACM response rates via [CultureAmp](https://cityyearacme.cultureamp.com/) to ensure your team gets at least five responses. Any team with less than five responces wont be able to see their results.

*If you have never created an account with CultureAmp, search your inbox for the welcome email to set-up your account.*

Michelle Ferarri should share more info about upcoming team and site data reviews.


## Focus List ACM Trainings

To continue moving forward in the focus list process, PMs must ensure their teams have gone through the following trainings:

## Preparing for HMH

As of FY22 only two schools will be using City Year reading and math assessments. For Manual Arts and 20th Street elemetary school please contact Impact Analytics for more details about implementing HMH at your schools.

You can also review the [HMH Toolkit](https://cylalighthouse.github.io/CYLA_Assessments_Toolkit/#/) as a headstart.

## Preparing for DESSA

The DESSA administrators of Aperture Education have sent out account activation emails to PMs and corps members with the subject line **"Your Aperture User Signup Invitation.”** Emails should have been sent to ACMs and PMs on 9/1 and 9/2 and need to be activated ***before 9/15.***

Please have ACMs follow the [guide](https://bit.ly/394dtkv) to activate their DESSA accounts. PMs should also activate their accounts through the same process. Contact Impact Analytics if you or your ACMs have trouble creating accounts and see this [quick walkthrough video](https://bit.ly/3k8BWLy). If anyone needs their invitation sent out again, please contact Chris Bischel.

>- The first DESSA administration will be in late November.
