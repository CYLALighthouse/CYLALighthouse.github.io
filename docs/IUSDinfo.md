IUSD Info

#### Accessing Mosaic

ACMs serving in a IUSD school will have access to student data via a platform call Schoolzille Mosaic. Here ACMs will have access to course performance, assessment, and demographics data for the students in their classes. They should use Schoolzilla Mosaic to help them select focus list students. In order for them to do this, PMs must walk them through the following two trainings:

> 1. [Mosaic Account Set-Up Training](https://bit.ly/3lj8TUZ)
> 2. [Mosaic Focus List Training](https://bit.ly/3kecFQt)
