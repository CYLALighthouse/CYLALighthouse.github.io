# CYLA Longitudinal Data Report FY13-FY21

This Power BI report contains City Year's data year over year. You will find the EOY (End of Year) student outcome data for our focus list students and a portion of the school population. Our data access is different year over year which effects the data we recieve for non-focus list students.

*A couple of things to note before going through the data is that:* 

- *Attendance data from 2018-2019 & 2019-2021 will **not** reflect a typical school yearand will be dramatically affected due to LAUSD teacher strike and COVID-19 pandemic.*
- *Data from the 2019 - 2020 school year will only reflect the first half of the school year due to COVID-19 pandemic. Any comparison from year to year will not be valid.*
- *Data from 2020-2021 school year will no be valid for year to year comparison due to virtual schooling due to COVID-19 pandemic.*
