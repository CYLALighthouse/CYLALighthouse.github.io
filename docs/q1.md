# Quarter #1 (Summer Planning)

<body><h3 style="background-color:darkslateblue;"><c style="color:white">July - August Items</h3></body>

The first quarter of the year starts in July before the corps has arrived for BTA. Analytics is at work getting teams prepared for service by running team placement, CACME engagement for incoming corps and general end of year closeout items. The first quarter involves a great deal of planning before we enter the school house around things like goal setting with partners, engaging with incoming ACMs, and planning out where your team will be placed in schools with teachers. See below a checklist of first quarter items, specific dates and directions for each task. 

<body><h3><i> <p style="color:darkturquoise">First Quarter Checklist</p></i></h3></body>

>- [ ] Engage incoming ACMs on your team via the [CACME PowerApp](https://bit.ly/3yPPzDC) by leveraging your [team demographics dashboards](https://bit.ly/2US97cg) or [the AllAboard Report](https://bit.ly/3hgfRsD)
>- [ ] **LAUSD ONLY** Work with school partners to provide a [Teacher Schedule Report](https://bit.ly/3ndG8vy) in CSV format to Analytics in [this folder](https://bit.ly/3ts6xXr)
>- [ ] Complete a draft version of [ACM in Class Deployment Workbook](https://bit.ly/3he0KjI) by leveraging your [team demographics dashboards](https://bit.ly/2US97cg) as needed
>- [ ] Check in with your TL to [review](elt.md) <a href="#elt"> ELT data processes </a>

   Analytics summer planning starts with engaging corps members who have been placed at your schools. The ACM onboarding team has worked all summer with Recruitment and Admissions to get your ACMs prepared for service and ready to show up to BTA. To view your teams and their unique dempographics, go to the [FY22 Team Demographics Power BI Report](https://bit.ly/3A5Xyyl). For step-by-step directions on accesing the report, view the directions below this video.

<h3><p style="color:darkturquoise"><i> Getting Teacher Roster Reports </i></p></h3>
</section>

   Data is key to much of what the Analytics team does each year but as a contractor for the district we can only get a limited scope of data and it must be stored securely. For both of our school districts the process of getting student data is different. See your school district below for more specifics on how to get school specific data for ACM deployment, focus lists and ELT.

<u><h4> Los Angeles Unified School District </h4></u>

   In June CYLA should communicate to LAUSD Office of Data and Accountability about re-establishing a data use contract for the coming school year. *This process has been historically slow and should be started as soon as possible*

   1. Program Directors (PDs) and or Program Managers (Pms) should assist in this process by asking their partners to run a teacher schedule report. Teacher schedule reports should be uploaded to this [folder](https://bit.ly/3ts6xXr)
   2. PDs should update the tracker.

      ```

<u><h4> Inglewood Unified School District </u></h4>

Inglewood uses a data platform called Schoolzilla to manage their data. City Year uses Schoolzilla to access student performance data for your schools. Sometime in the first quarter the Analytics team will provide a training specifically for IUSD schools on how to access Schoolzilla for viewing student performance data.

<section id="draft-deployment-workbook">
<h3><p style="color:darkturquoise"><i> Draft Deployment Workbook </i></p></h3>
</section>

 2. Program Managers (PMs) should fill out a draft depoyment workbook to assign ACMs to class lines as they wait for teacher schedule reports from their school. Directions on how to get and use a draft deployment workbook can be foud in the section below.
      - Use [Team Demographics Dashboard](https://bit.ly/2US97cg) to help you place ACMs into class lines 
 
In the summer, as you plan with partners where ACMs will be placed into class lines, please fill out a copy of the draft deployment workbook. The IA team has build out the Team Demographics Dashboard to assist with this process by providing information that might help with assigning class lines. See the section below for more info on the dashboard.

This workbook will be a placeholder for the Final Deployment Workbook that will be released when you have submitted a teacher schedule report. The final workbook will then become a key part of our data model and will be used to get access to student data from those specified class lines. Without a draft or final deployment, our team will not be able to access data for students in ACM classes, please complete as soon as possible.

<h3><p style="color:darkturquoise"><i> Extended Learning Time </i></p></h3>
</section>

With a new data use agreement from both of our school districts in FY21 our after school data management processes need to undergo some changes. Additionally corps members have expressed how complicated tracking time in ELT has been so, in FY22 the Analytics team is hoping to make some simplifications and improvements to ELT attendance tracking while **also adding some important steps** to comply with our new data agreements.


<h3><p style="color:darkorange"> ELT Proccess </p></h3>

<h3><p style="color:dodgerblue"> ELT Applications </p></h3>

As part of our data agreement with LAUSD all students will need to have an ELT application on file BEFORE attending after school programming in FY22. If a student attends ELT without an application City Year runs the risk of being sued if anything happens to the child while they are in the care of City Year (This has happened in the past). To ensure that we are protecting ourselves legally AND that we are keeping students safe by having emergency contact information on hand for our students we will need all students to have an ELT application and to have that application digitized into the ELT workbooks on Cyconnect.
To learn more about the applications processes see [this video.]()

<h3><p style="color:dodgerblue"> ELT Workbooks </p></h3>

Part of the role of a team leader will be to ensure all ELT applications, student enrollment and time in and out is recorded daily on the Analytics provided Extended Learning Time Workbooks. The two main purposes of these ELT workbooks are to verify student ELT applications and to provide a space for tracking program attendance so that we can determine if our program is meeting our desired outcomes.

ELT workbooks should be available to team leaders in early August and specific trainings for team leaders will be upcoming. Come back for links to said trainings and resources later.

<h3><p style="color:dodgerblue"> ELT Roles </p></h3>

Below is a table that helps to clarify the roles of everyone in after school data management. While the program manager is ultimately the person who supervises all school based activities we view the Team Leader as the owner of most day to day extended learning time activities, logistics and execution. This is particularly true when it involves the data that is being managed for ELT. 

Team leaders will be the people that Impact Analytics reaches out to when ELT applications need to be entered into the system, when student IDs need correcting, when time entry needs to happen more regularly and more. We hope to have regular check ins with team leaders to support them in all of these tasks moving forward.
